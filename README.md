# Treatment Protocols and Philosophical Foundations

## FULL VESSEL ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS

**Master Point (MP) and Couple Point (CP):**
- Both needed to fully activate extraordinary vessel
- Using only master point insufficient according to classical texts
- Without both points, meridian not fully activated in extraordinary vessel theory tradition

**Gender-Based Point Selection:**
- **Males:** MP on left, CP on right
- **Females:** MP on right, CP on left

**When Using Trajectory Points:**
- Open MP and respective CP first
- Then needle trajectory points bilaterally
- Usually use long tonification technique

---

## PAIRING EXTRAORDINARY VESSELS

**Definition:**
- Activating two separate vessels simultaneously

**Cautions:**
- Not for new practitioners
- Requires knowledge, clinical experience, and detailed understanding of how each vessel functions independently
- Recommended pairing not occur too soon in treatment
- Only when practitioner has adequate knowledge of vessels

**Li Shi Zhen's Approach:**
- Discussed pairings as reflection of clinical findings
- Clinical work revealed how extraordinary vessels function in health and disease
- Outlined functional relationships both independently and when paired

**How to Pair:**
- Needle MP and CP of each vessel separately
- Example: Pairing Chong Mai and Ren Mai → open MP and CP of Chong Mai first, then open MP and CP of Ren Mai

**Value:**
- Can be valuable for certain conditions and/or unique cases

---

## NEEDLE RETENTION TIME

**General Rules:**
- 20-40 minutes acceptable
- 30 minutes minimum optimal
- Good rule of thumb: No less than 20 minutes, no more than 1 hour

**30-Minute Rule:**
- Optimal for activating vessels
- Requires patient to engage in deep emotional work
- Sufficient time must be allotted for process
- Yields gentler and slower effect

**20-Minute Rule:**
- Will work but vessel may need activation more than three-week series method allows
- May work best for patients needing slower pace for deeper work

**Rationale:**
- Patient needs stability between treatments
- Important to allow ample time to acclimate to vessel activation
- Evidence suggests classical theory treatment won't put patient at emotional risk
- Treatments powerful, impact different and unpredictable for each patient

---

## TREATMENT FREQUENCY

**Ideal Schedule:**
- Once weekly for 3 weeks without break
- Optimal to fully activate vessel

**Alternative Schedule:**
- If cannot come weekly for 3 weeks: At least every 2 weeks until sessions completed

---

## STANDARD COURSE OF TREATMENT

**Example Protocol:**
- Patient visits 3 times total, one week between treatments
- Practitioner decides to activate Yin Wei Mai based on diagnostic protocol

**Treatment 1:**
- MP and CP only (two points used)

**Treatment 2:**
- MP and CP opened
- 2-3 points on trajectory needled bilaterally

**Treatment 3:**
- MP, CP, and 2-4 points bilaterally on trajectory

**Benefits:**
- Series of 3 treatments with natural progression of adding trajectory points
- Safe and beneficial method for novice to learn eight extraordinary vessel treatment

---

## MOXA USAGE

**General Rule:**
- MP and CP generally not combined with moxa
- Trajectory points can be treated with moxa if practitioner deems appropriate

---

## NEEDLE TECHNIQUE

**For MP and CP:**
- No need to lift, thrust, or twist needles
- Needle technique must be gentle and without action
- Allow wisdom of body to make best decision
- Use "even technique" (no needle action)
- Simple insertion to fen depth
- **Adage:** "Less is more"

**Rationale:**
- Practitioner manipulating patient's constitutional platform (chakra system)
- Important to set stage for patient to experience stability facing potentially challenging emotional work
- Vessels dynamic enough on their own with simple needle insertion

---

## TRAJECTORY POINTS

**Nature:**
- Not part of vessel itself
- Merely access points whereby practitioners gain entry to vessels

**Needling:**
- Points on respective trajectories needled bilaterally
- Acceptable to perform slight tonification or sedation technique when patient deficient or excess, respectively
- Moxa can be applied to trajectory points only

**Usage:**
- Beneficial during extraordinary vessel treatments for specific conditions (physical, mental, or emotional)
- Advised to add gradually to not overwhelm patient's energetic body
- Practitioners may select using same manner as theories outside eight extraordinary model

**Enhanced Meaning:**
- Intention: Enhance energetic system beyond MP and CP
- Maintain integrity and function according to any theory employed
- When used in extraordinary context: Magnified and take on more spiritual role depending on meridian and point selected
- Example: Ki-9 builds/nourishes/supports Kidney meridian generally; in eight extraordinary context takes on role of deepening intrinsic wisdom of patient

---

## OFF-TRAJECTORY POINTS

**Usage:**
- Can be used in advanced eight extraordinary treatments
- Unusual, but cases exist

**Guidelines:**
- Best to use trajectory points on targeted vessel for at least first 3 treatments
- After completion, may be beneficial to treat vessel again
- At that point generally safe to add:
  - Points not on any of eight extraordinary vessels, OR
  - Trajectory point from one of other seven extraordinary vessels (but not the one being opened)
- Skilled practitioner with experience will learn to discern between points over time

**For Beginners:**
- Not advised to use off-trajectory points
- More beneficial to become well versed in theory first

---

## TREATMENT SUMMARY

**First Treatment:** MP + CP only

**Second Treatment:** MP + CP + 2-3 trajectory points

**Third Treatment:** MP + CP + 2-4 trajectory points

**Advanced Treatments:**
- Triple Burner points can be added to assist energetic communication throughout body

---

## NATURE OF EIGHT EXTRAORDINARY VESSELS

**Function:**
- Overarching regulators of yin and yang
- By extension, modulators of rest of channel system
- Maintain degree of autonomy despite close associations with other channels
- Each vessel exerts own influence on every channel to some extent
- No single extraordinary vessel may be conceptualized in relation to any one primary channel

**Pathology:**
- Chronic diseases ultimately afflict extraordinary vessels
- Over time excess conditions can accumulate within system
- Can be mix of excess and deficiency conditions within these vessels in individual
- Even relatively minor deficiencies tend to reflect significant compromise in health

---

## SPIRITUAL CULTIVATION (Li Shi Zhen)

**Profound Role:**
- More profound and important role in relation to spiritual cultivation
- In internal alchemy, essence qi refers to "primordial qi of cosmos"
- Essence qi originates from Kidneys
- Essence qi necessary to undertake spiritual cultivation

**Essence Qi Protection:**
- "Burning candle at both ends" deprives highest potential of spiritual cultivation
- Draining of essence qi must be avoided
- To achieve highest spiritual potential, imperative essence qi not compromised

**Physical and Spiritual Connection:**
- Physical conditions not separate from spiritual deficiency
- Spiritual deficiencies will manifest in body physically at some point in growth cycle
- Internal cultivation cannot take place in vacuum
- Running away and hiding in cave may sound appealing
- Only through direct experience can we ultimately grow internally and fulfill life's work in present life
- Otherwise, simply hiding out

---

## DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS

**Diagnosis Methods:**
- Tongue
- Pulses
- Behavior
- Lifestyle
- Constitutional nature
- Signs and symptoms

**Simple Protocol for Beginners:**

**Sequence (Treating Vessels One by One):**
1. Yin Qiao Mai × 3
2. Yang Qiao Mai × 3
3. Yin Wei Mai × 3
4. Yang Wei Mai × 3

**Pairing Considerations:**
- Yin Qiao Mai and Yang Qiao Mai can be paired
- Yin Wei Mai and Yang Wei Mai can be paired IF:
  - Patient emotionally stable
  - Has support structure (family, friends, community contact)
  - Support would recognize any need for intervention during long-term treatment
- Typically treat each vessel 3 times before moving to next
- If pairing, each pairing done 3 times before moving to next vessel

**Protocol for Treating Paired Vessels:**
1. Yin Qiao Mai and Yang Qiao Mai × 3
2. Yin Wei Mai and Yang Wei Mai × 3

---

## MOVING TO FOUR PRIMARIES

**After Qiao Mai and Wei Mai Success:**
- Can begin work on four primaries (Ren Mai, Du Mai, Chong Mai, Dai Mai)

**Recommended Sequence Options:**
1. Chong Mai → Ren Mai → Du Mai → Dai Mai
2. Ren Mai → Du Mai → Chong Mai → Dai Mai
3. Du Mai → Ren Mai → Chong Mai → Dai Mai

**Rules:**
- Ren Mai and Du Mai always consecutive in treatment
- Dai Mai always treated last
- Primaries may be paired but generally are not
- Only treat one vessel at a time before starting next
- While primaries can be paired, recommended each primary vessel be treated independently

---

## PATIENT EMOTIONAL STABILITY MONITORING

**If Patient Becomes Overwhelmed/Unstable:**
- May need to break from extraordinary vessel treatments
- Or stop pairing vessels
- If patient emotionally distraught/overwhelmed:
  - Continue treating vessel
  - Stop pairing both yin and yang
  - Treat each vessel independently: Yang Qiao Mai, Yin Qiao Mai, Yang Wei Mai, Yin Wei Mai (respectively)

**If Patient Emotionally Unstable:**
- Practitioner should stop treatments
- Return to twelve primaries to support person
- Kidney and Spleen points always beneficial for returning patient to stable ground
- If appropriate, Heart and/or Pericardium points can stabilize shen

**Resumption:**
- Beneficial if practitioner and patient determine can resume within two-week period
- Especially important to monitor patient closely

---

## TREATMENT TIMING

**Ideal Circumstances:**
- Patient receives 3 treatments within 3 weeks
- Short break between vessels
- Then start next set of extraordinary vessel treatments

**Variability:**
- Time between treatments varies based on individual patient

---

## LATENT CONDITIONS

**During Treatment:**
- Latent conditions may manifest during course of treatment
- Conditions must be expressed as they clear from body, mind, spirit
- In these cases, practitioner should continue with established course of treatment per protocol

---

## WHEN TO SKIP PROTOCOL

**Systematic Approach:**
- Starting with Qiao Mai and working through vessels in specific order recommended but not necessary
- Main reason for systematic approach: More conservative and gentle for beginner
- Treating Qiao Mai and Wei Mai first = treating physical body (container) first
- Ensures stable enough to withstand clearing and healing of primaries
- Like building house: Ensure foundations, walls, roof in good order before renovating inside

**Reasons to Jump Protocol (Skip Qiao Mai and Wei Mai):**
1. Infertility
2. Acute emotional or mental distress (e.g., suicide attempts)
3. Person doing well with healthy Qiao Mai and Wei Mai

**Note:**
- Treating primaries first doesn't indicate absence of pathology in Qiao Mai and Wei Mai
- In all likelihood would have to treat these vessels at some point during long-term treatment strategy

---

## DETERMINING HEALTH OF QIAO MAI AND WEI MAI

**Assessment Factors:**
- Patient's self-esteem
- Ability to adapt to change
- Physical symptoms

**Healthy Qiao Mai Indicators:**
- Pleased with who they are
- Feel free to be spontaneous
- Capable of dancing with life gracefully
- Can take what comes their way
- Navigate emotions in healthy manner
- Musculoskeletal structure in good health and condition

**Healthy Wei Mai Indicators:**
- Able to live fully in present moment
- Not focusing on past or living in future (not obsessive about future decisions)
- Comfortable living in present moment
- See it as precious time
- Generally optimistic
- Able to see benefit or lessons in each moment, no matter circumstance
- No internal issues (e.g., fatty liver, digestive issues)

**Additional Indicators:**
- Nutrition essential to healthy communication between Qiao Mai and Wei Mai
- Food cravings, sensitivities, allergies provide information about vessel conditioning

**When to Start Where:**
- One physical structure concern → wise to start on Qiao Mai
- One internal issue (fatty liver, digestive issues) → wise to treat Wei Mai first

**Treatment Decision:**
- If patient meets criteria for healthy Qiao Mai and Wei Mai: Treating four primaries initially generally not a problem
- If pathology in Qiao Mai and/or Wei Mai: Patient better served by receiving treatment according to established protocol

---

## PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH

**Critical Principle:**
- Crucial to keep course of treatment patient-centered
- Requires continuous observation and re-evaluation
- Monitor patient feedback regarding experience from one treatment to next

**Conceptual Framework:**
- Qiao Mai = "structure"
- Wei Mai = guts inside structure (the "mushy gushy")

---

## THE ART OF PAIRING

**Controversial Topic:**
- Li Shi Zhen taught: Eight extraordinary vessels "not controlled by 12 main channels nor arranged in exterior-interior combinations"
- Fact that Chong Mai and Yin Wei Mai share same point combination doesn't automatically mean should be paired
- Pairing more about how vessels work interdependently

**Natural Pairings:**

**Yin and Yang Qiao Mai:**
- Work so closely together often paired
- Based on how they function in body and complement one another

**Yin and Yang Wei Mai:**
- Function in reciprocity within body
- Basis for their pairing

**Four Primaries Pairing:**
- More advanced technique
- Ideally not done hastily or without serious consideration

**Appropriate Primary Pairings:**

1. **Ren Mai and Du Mai:**
   - Most acceptable pairing of primaries
   - Because of Microcosmic Orbit and relationship to internal cultivation

2. **Chong Mai and Dai Mai:**
   - Seemingly thrown together by default
   - Do complement one another
   - Dai Mai: Belt or Girdle Vessel (horizontal trajectory binding all vessels)
   - Functions outside in (when belt too tight or loose, entire system affected)
   - Chong Mai: Interior boundary (all vessels have relationship with Chong Mai directly or indirectly)
   - Functions inside out
   - Creates complementary relationship

**Nature of Vessels:**
- Eight extraordinary vessels contain excess from twelve primary channels
- Can exist with certain types of deficiencies
- Can be mixed conditions
- Regulate blood and qi in body
- Can be viewed as "overseers" of body

---

## CASE STUDIES SUMMARY

**Case Study 2 (Early 40s Female):**
- Infertility (suspected)
- Yin Wei Mai × 3, then Chong Mai × 9
- Result: Pregnant at treatment 13
- Later emotional work with Yin Wei Mai

- Fertility support, varicocele
- Wei Mai paired × 2, then Chong Mai × 10
- Chong paired with Ren × 4
- Result: Wife pregnant one year after starting

**Case Study 4 (Late 40s Female):**
- Relationship difficulties, trauma history
- Full iteration of eight vessels with breaks
- 36 extraordinary vessel treatments over several years
- Result: Significant emotional growth, improved relationships

**Case Study 5 (49-Year-Old Male):**
- Psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease
- Qiao Mai paired, then Du Mai (multiple times)
- Result: Manages pain with integrative approach

**Case Study 6 (68-Year-Old Woman):**
- Morbid obesity, emotional eating
- Two full iterations of eight vessels
- Result: Significant emotional health improvement, minimal weight loss but profound understanding

## CONCLUDING PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTIONS

**Phenomena and Reality:**
- Buddhist idea: Phenomena we see/experience not real
- Expression of karmic consequences and conditions
- Still must treat disease when arises (e.g., cancer)
- Two venues for karmic expression:
  - **Conventional reality:** Experience through five senses
  - **Ultimate reality:** Phenomena appear like movie, watch without reaction

**Pain as Teacher:**
- Pain brings us to present moment
- Teacher, messenger, game changer
- Easily one of hardest sets of circumstances for humans to endure
- Once pain subsides: Evaluate from internal alchemical perspective

**Emotional Flow:**
- Allow emotions to rise and watch them
- Refrain from repressing/oppressing
- Act appropriately, let move through without impact
- Watch it arise, be present, let it go (like waves in ocean)
- If humans could allow such flow instead of holding emotions and believing them "real," might prevent cancer from happening

**Objective Platform:**
- View lives from more objective platform
- Experience selves as happier and more content
- Understanding that activity neither existent nor non-existent
- Simply eruption and expression of karmic consequences
- Respond as serene observers
- Instantly alleviate intense suffering

**Eight Extraordinary Vessels Mystery:**
- Mysterious yet can open doors to new existence
- Work about unblocking mysteries of life
- Unleashing and accepting pearls of life
- Allowing for bigger picture (lifetime to lifetime)
- Journey unbelievable yet highly intellectual (not literal)
- No dogma
- Often described as "drunk with bliss of wisdom"

**Full Circle Theory:**
- Moment to moment critical in resolution of karmic consequences
- For this life, then next
- Container to carry out mission of consciousness for long haul
- Until full enlightenment
- Not at ego's judgment or opinion
- Experienced as ultimate non-attachment
- Unconditional love reverberating throughout
- Felt by masses in immeasurable and indescribable way
- Language becomes limited, useless, unable to steer course
- Life becomes more pictorial and experiential

# Diagnostic Methods and Treatment Techniques

## PALPATION METHODS

**What to Find:**
- Pressure pain
- Tension
- Tightness
- Looseness
- Swelling
- Flaccidity
- Weakness
- Knots
- Lack of elasticity

**Technique:**
- Use fingers to steady hand
- Palpate with thumbs
- Always be consistent
- Begin with gentle pressure
- If no reaction elicited, use firmer pressure to confirm point not reactive

**Classical Instructions:**
- Cryptic suggestions like "investigate the Ren Mai" or "choose a point" should be interpreted as instructions to palpate meridian pathway

---

## PHYSICAL AND STRUCTURAL EFFECTS

**Vessel-Specific Patterns:**
- **Du Mai:** Treats rigidity of spine
- **Dai Mai:** Treats imbalance of one side of body from ribs down to legs
- **Yin and Yang Qiao Mai:** Treat relative tension and looseness of medial and lateral aspects of legs
- **Yang Qiao Mai:** Treats tightness of lumbar area and back when bending, feeling of fullness or swelling on one side of body

**Recognition:**
- Topological nature of extraordinary vessels recognized for long time
- Useful to combine vessel symptomology with palpatory diagnosis and topological relationships

---

## CLASSICAL PALPATION RECOMMENDATIONS

**Sources:**
- Zhen Jing Zhi Nan
- Zhen Jiu Ju Ying
- Zhen Jiu Da Cheng

**Instructions:**
- Examine upper, lower, left, and right parts
- No clear or systematic description of palpatory and topological relationships in older books
- Modern practitioners (Dr. Manaka, Mr. Ito) give clear descriptions that help understand older books

---

## MEETING/CORRESPONDENCE POINTS

**Description:**
- Points on extraordinary vessel pathways
- Describe "dividing lines of the body" (Dr. Manaka)
- Great diagnostic and therapeutic usefulness

**Zhen Jiu Da Cheng Quote:**
"One has to examine the right and left, upper and lower {parts of the body}... Feel and palpate the body to find something with your hands, then do some exercises and take the disease away with the {eight} points. This is the rule, according to the rule, one can remove diseases. If the diseases do not pass, one has to ask {palpate} the meeting points {and treat them}..."

**Interpretation:**
- Meeting points could be:
  - He points (around elbows and knees)
  - Meeting points of extraordinary vessels
- Same character used in either case
- In Da Cheng context, more likely refers to extraordinary vessel meeting points
- Similar discussions in Zhen Jing Zhi Nan and Zhen Jiu Ju Ying make more sense referring to he points

**Classical Instruction:**
"Make the upper and lower parts connect, make {the patient} comfortable, taking away the suffering or pain."

---

## DR. MANAKA'S TREATMENT APPROACH

**Adoptions from Classical Recommendations:**
- Uses palpatory diagnosis
- Uses therapeutic exercises
- Connects upper and lower parts using extraordinary vessels
- Emphasizes patient comfort and relaxation during treatment
- Meeting points as further step, used as required

**Advantage:**
- Easy to use
- Approaches problem from variety of different directions

---

## TREATMENT TECHNIQUES - CLASSICAL AMBIGUITY

**Lack of Clear Instructions:**
- Few descriptions of needle or moxa techniques in old books
- Zhen Jiu Da Cheng has descriptions for tonification and dispersion, but no indication these apply to extraordinary vessel points
- No reference to tonifying or dispersing the eight points
- Difficult to know exact needle technique to use

**Polarity Questions:**
- Not clear if needles inserted bilaterally, contralaterally, or ipsilaterally
- Most texts refer to inserting master point first, then coupled point
- Hints that needles should be oriented according to:
  - Side of body affected
  - Location of problem
  - Findings from palpation of "right, left, upper and lower parts"

**Practitioner Variation:**
- Both classical and modern practitioners had their own treatment approaches
- Most use some idea of polarity or topology
- These not always clearly defined

---

## POINT COMBINATION APPROACHES

### ZHEN JING ZHI NAN AND ZHEN JIU JU YING METHOD:

**Sequence:**
1. Treat master points first
2. Followed by coupled points
3. Master point selection determined by:
   - Examination of symptom complexes
   - Findings of palpation
   - Location of problem
4. After points inserted: "Dao Yin" (Daoist breathing exercises)
5. If problem not cured: Select corresponding he points
6. When patient comfortable and relaxed: Remove needles

**He Point Selection:**
- Selected from meridians corresponding to each symptom
- Example for Sp-4 (Chong Mai):

| Symptom | Meridian |
|---------|----------|
| Nine kinds of heart pain | Heart, Stomach |
| Diarrhea that won't stop | Large Intestine, Stomach |
| Umbilicus and abdomen swollen/painful | Triple Warmer, Stomach |

**Conceptual Framework:**
- All symptoms belong to larger set of conditions treated through Chong Mai
- Each also member of subset related to particular meridian
- Can be treated through: Chong Mai, particular meridian he points, or both

**Gao Wu's Analogy:**
"If we think about this treatment style, it is really broad, it's like trying to catch a single rabbit in a field with a massive net."
- Extraordinary vessel = massive net
- Symptom = rabbit
- Associated meridian he point = hand net

**Historical Significance:**
- Correspondences possibly influential for later development of:
  - Differential diagnosis
  - Symptom complexes
  - Point selection

---

### ZHEN JIU DA CHENG METHOD:

**When Treating Just Extraordinary Vessel Points:**
- Treat master point first, then coupled point
- Decisions about master point and polarity similar to Zhi Nan and Ju Ying
- Refers to exercises (not specifically Dao Yin)
- Followed by treatment of he points (likely refers to correspondence/meeting points of eight extraordinary vessels, not meridian he points)

**When Treating Symptom Complexes:**
- Describes specific sets of treatments combining extraordinary vessel points with other body points
- Always require treatment of master point followed by rest of points in sequence
- Master point in combination with other body points was sufficient
- Coupled points not necessary

**Point Repetition:**
- Occasionally a point appears twice in lists
- Indicates points treated in sequence with in-and-out needle techniques
- Not simultaneously while retaining needles

**Main Effects:**
- Four yin points: Treat mainly organ, deeper, more yin problems
- Four yang points: Treat mainly non-organ, superficial, yang problems

---

## NEEDLE AND MOXA TECHNIQUES

**General Recommendations:**
- Using modern acupuncture techniques is sufficient
- No clear statements of treatment techniques in classical texts
- Recommend insertion to needle depths generally specified for each acupoint

**Modern Extraordinary Vessel Style:**
- Generally use shallow insertions
- Barely insert needles
- Not necessary to "get the qi"
- Avoid "dull, heavy, aching, distended" sensation associated with some modern standing insertion methods

**Classical Consideration:**
- Some practitioners feel technique can change effect of point needled
- Successful modern practitioners use shallower insertion methods
- Worth considering classical practitioners may have found less assertive technique more successful

---

## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Disease Descriptions:**
- Some diseases in Da Cheng and Ju Ying no longer exist or much less common
- In these cases, disease rendered as series of symptoms describing problem
- Where possible, clear western disease names provided

**Treatment Source Awareness:**
- Be aware of treatment considerations of source
- Style associated with Da Cheng is essential element of information (if not totally clear)

# Yin and Yang Wei Mai Symptomology and Classical Treatments

## EARLY CLASSICAL REFERENCES (Su Wen)

**Yang Wei Mai:**
- Swelling and pain on lumbar area
- Irritability
- Swollen spot on painful area
- Treatment: Insert needle into Yang Wei vessel on external aspect of leg, 10 divisions above bottom of heel, where it meets Tai Yang
- Point possibly GB-35

**Yin Wei Mai:**
- Lumbar pain caused by fei yang vessel
- Swelling on painful spot or irritability with pain
- If gets worse: People become afraid and sad
- Treatment: Insert needle 5 divisions above internal ankle (fei yang point), in front of kidney meridian, at meeting place of Yin Wei Mai
- Usually seen as Ki-9

---

## NAN JING DESCRIPTIONS

**More Clearly Emotional:**

**Yang Wei Mai Disease:**
- Both physical and emotional suffering of cold or heat symptoms

**Yin Wei Mai Disease:**
- Both physical and emotional suffering of heart pain symptoms

**Emotional Relationship:**
- Yin and yang cannot balance
- Visible emotions: Thinking too much, obsession, loss of will, lack of self-control

---

## WANG SHU HE THEORETICAL STATEMENTS

**Yang Wei Mai:**
- Yang is wei (protecting), controls the surface
- Wei is qi
- Yang accepts evil, disease stays at surface (not at lining)
- Cold and heat bother patient

**Yin Wei Mai:**
- Yin is ying (nourishing)
- Ying is blood
- Heart controls blood (why patient bothered by heart pain)

**Relationship Confirmation:**
- Reconfirms relationship of Triple Warmer and Pericardium to:
  - Surface (wei qi) through TW-5 (Yang Wei Mai treatment point)
  - Lining (ying qi) through Pc-6 (Yin Wei Mai treatment point)
  - Via their luo points

**Pulse and Symptoms:**

**Yang Wei Mai Problem:**
- Pulse: Floating
- Symptoms:
  - Brief eye dizziness
  - Yang excess
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Needing to raise shoulders to breathe
  - Feelings of coldness

**Yin Wei Mai Problem:**
- Pulse: Big and full
- Symptoms:
  - Pain in chest
  - Feelings of fullness at sides of body below ribs accompanying heart pain
  - Males: If pulse feels like "ball passing beneath fingers" → fullness at sides of ribs and lumbar pain
  - Females: Pain in sexual organ that feels like wound or injury

# Clinical Applications of the Eight Extraordinary Channels

## THREE COMMON APPROACHES IN MODERN PRACTICE

**1. Constitutional Conditions:**
- Most constitutional channels with closest relationship to Kidneys and Jing
- Treat Jing conditions
- Use for constitutional, chronic, or Yuan level conditions only
- Avoid using Jing for conditions that Ying and Wei substances can treat (inefficient use of vital substances)

**2. Channel Conditions:**
- Use to treat problems occurring on Eight Extraordinary Channel pathways
- Select points along pathways to treat the condition

**3. Polarity Conditions:**
- Use when imbalances exist between sides of body and their channels
- Balance and harmonize polarities
- Include left/right and top/bottom point prescriptions

---

## QUALITIES OF THE EIGHT EXTRAORDINARY CHANNELS

**General Properties:**
- Each channel contains prenatal influences and qualities
- Each channel contains postnatal influences and qualities
- Postnatal influences can enter Jing or Yuan level and become part of constitution
- Each channel influences physical aspects of body
- Each channel influences certain anatomical areas
- Each channel corresponds to emotional and psychological qualities

**Vital Substances:**
- Each channel has stronger influence on certain vital substances
- Example: Du channel strongly influences Yang and qi
- Example: Ren channel strongly influences Yin and blood

**Channel Relationships:**
- Each has stronger relationships with certain channels in acupuncture network
- Example: Du channel controls Yang and Wei qi, strong influence on sinew channels

**Functions:**
- Each channel has numerous functions
- Objective: Stimulate channel to perform its function
- Requires few points on channel (one point usually not enough)
- Goal: Sequence points together to stimulate channel and restore normal function
- Key: Combining channels and points to create synergy

**Combinations:**
- Channels can be combined according to numerous principles
- No definitive combinations better than others
- Combine based on ability to treat condition, not just popular combinations

---

## DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK

**Four Diagnostic Methods:**

1. **Based on Energetic Properties:**
   - Diagnosis made based on energetic properties of each Eight Extraordinary Channel

2. **Based on Location:**
   - Diagnosis made based on location on pathway
   - Example: Uterus issues would include Chong and Ren (they originate there)

3. **Based on Palpation:**
   - Palpate points and areas along trajectories
   - Needle areas and ashi points along trajectory
   - Can be actual Eight Extraordinary Channel points or areas along pathway

4. **Based on Vital Substance Relationships:**
   - Example: Ren is Sea of Yin (treat body fluids or blood conditions)
   - Example: Du is Sea of Yang (influences Yang, qi, Wei qi, heat, Fire, wind)

---

## COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT APPROACH

**Step-by-Step Method:**

1. Select confluent point of root problem channel or predominant channel. Needle on one side.

2. Select cleft point (if channel has one).

3. Select Eight Extraordinary Channel points on pathways:
   - Pick points where function relates to condition
   - Pick ashi areas
   - Pick point in anatomical area related to condition (near organ or muscular-skeletal region)
   - Pick point near energy center or vital substances to be treated

4. Select points from other Eight Extraordinary Channels being used in treatment.

5. Close Eight Extraordinary Channels portion with confluent point of second channel (if used). Needle opposite side from first confluent point.
   - Example: Chong and Ren treatment: Begin Sp-4 left, end Lu-7 right
   - If one channel used: Treat point bilaterally

6. Select confluent point based on gender, needle one side then opposite of paired channels:
   - **Postnatal conditions:** Left for males, right for females (right is Yin, left is Yang)
   - **Prenatal conditions:** Left for females, right for males (left is Yin, right is Yang)

7. Select relevant points from primary channels.

---

## CHANNEL AND POINT SELECTION STRATEGIES

1. Select confluent point only

2. Combine confluent point with its Ming dynasty coupled paired point

3. Combine confluent point, corresponding cleft point, and coupled paired point

4. Select any combinations of confluent points based on diagnostic method (not just Ming dynasty pairings). Use any combination that fits diagnosis.

5. Select confluent point and relevant points along pathway. Needle confluent point, pathway points, then closing confluent point.

6. Select points that balance upper/lower and right/left areas of body. Create prescription with balance throughout body.

7. Select confluent point, coupled pair confluent point, and pathway points. Include non-pathway points relevant to condition.
   - Example: For essence deficiency, select Chong points plus points that reinforce Kidneys (Ki-3, UB-23, Ren-4)

8. Needle confluent-paired points; if symptoms don't diminish, select corresponding sea point.
   - Example: If Sp-4 used for Chong Mai, add Sp-9 (sea point)

9. Use Eight Extraordinary Channels for chronic, deep, or constitutional conditions. Use for Yuan level conditions only.

10. **Pool of Points to Consider:**
    - Source points
    - Sea points
    - Front mu points
    - Back shu points
    - San Jiao points (closely related to source qi and Jing)
    - Kidney points
    - Gallbladder points
    - Eight influential points
    - Divergent channel confluent points
    - Four Sea points:
      - **Sea of Qi:** St-9, UB-10, Ren-17, Du-14, Du-15
      - **Sea of Blood:** UB-11, St-37, St-39
      - **Sea of Grain:** St-30, St-36
      - **Sea of Marrow:** Du-16, Du-20

11. **When Selecting Pathway Points Consider:**
    - Cleft points on Eight Extraordinary Channels
    - Actual points on pathway (especially if anatomically close to pathology)
    - Actual points from channel involved in pathology (Example: Spleen pathology → use Sp-13, Sp-15, or Sp-16 from Yin Wei)
    - Use actual pathway points as landmarks, palpate for ashi points and needle them
    - Needling confluent point, pathway points, and paired confluent point stimulates and activates pathways and vital substances
    - Select points from primary channels that relate to treatment
    - Select points from sinew and luo channels if condition influences those channels

12. **Timeframe Considerations:**
    - Eight Extraordinary Channels involve Jing (long cycles of unfolding)
    - Treat chronic pathologies and patterns
    - Healing process takes more time than acute conditions
    - Slow moving level
    - Profound experience possible in one treatment, but takes time to enter deeper levels
    - Patient has choice whether to make necessary changes for transformation

13. Combine any combinations of Eight Extraordinary Channels (not just Ming dynasty pairings).
    - Example: Insomnia with chronic dysmenorrhea could include Yin Wei and Dai channels

---

## COMBINING CHANNEL SYSTEMS

**Sinew Channels:**
- Use for muscular-skeletal conditions
- When chronic emotional, postural, or lifestyle conditions influence muscular-skeletal system:
  - Treat sinew channels for pain
  - Treat Eight Extraordinary Channels for chronic patterns causing muscular-skeletal conditions

**Luo Channels:**
- Treat blood conditions and emotions
- Use for emotions, especially acute emotional conditions
- If emotions chronic and constitutional:
  - Use Eight Extraordinary Channels for chronic aspect
  - Use luo channels for acute nature

**Primary Channels:**
- Treat internal organs
- Eight Extraordinary Channels support primary channels and internal organs
- Eight Extraordinary Channels guide vital substances to primary channels and internal organs

**Divergent Channels:**
- Further connection of Yin-Yang paired channels
- Connect Yin-Yang layers of body (Wei and Yuan layers and qi)
- Link to all channels of body
- Support all channel systems
- Guide vital substances to organs
  - Example: Kidney Yang deficiency → needle Du channel to gather Kidney Yang, Kidney and Bladder divergent channels to guide Yang to Kidneys
- Release conditions latent in body
  - Example: Chronic anger with Liver heat and Fire → treat Liver and Gallbladder divergent channels to release pattern, Dai channel to help release energies and patterns
- Maintain latency: Guide qi and substances to area, allowing body to manage condition

---

## NEEDLING METHODS

**Two Main Strategies from Nei Jing:**

**1. Reinforcing:**
- Direct vital substances to area to supplement, reinforce, tonify, or nourish
- Guide, direct, and move substances to area
- Direct person to focus on specific areas of life
- Example: After releasing sadness/depression/grief, use reinforcing method to direct attention to Heart shen

**2. Reducing:**
- Direct away, release, clear, or sedate
- Diminish or release current intensities
- Example: Release person from emotional intensity of anger situation

**Acupuncture Points as Portals:**
- Every portal contains two dimensions: interior and exterior
- Every point can be reinforced (guiding inside) or reduced (guiding outside)

**Two Principles for Needling Methods:**

**Method 1 - Based on Organ Function:**
- Yang organs empty → treated to release excess and pathogenic factors (release from own organ and Yin-Yang paired organ)
- Yin organs gather and store → treated to assist gathering and storing (store for Yin-Yang paired organ)
- Example: Liver qi stagnation → treat Gallbladder points, not Liver points

**Method 2 - Based on Treatment Strategy:**
- Apply reinforcing or reducing technique on points based on desired response
- Not based on organ functions
- Example: Liver qi stagnation → sedate Liver points (e.g., Lv-3)

---

## GENERAL NEEDLING TECHNIQUES

**Basic Approach:**
1. Palpate Eight Extraordinary Channel points to activate point(s), qi, and channel, then needle
2. Vibrating and shaking technique used in past
3. Lifting and thrusting technique mimics vibrating and shaking (effective method)
4. Needle at deep level (representative of Yuan and constitutional level)
5. Follow treatment plan

**Treatment Duration:**
- 30-40 minutes common treatment time
- 3-6 months timeframe to evaluate treatments at this level
- Takes time to move and transform Jing/essence

---

## THREE REINFORCING AND REDUCING TECHNIQUES (from Nei Jing)

**From Su Wen Chapter 54 and Ling Shu Chapters 1 & 3:**

| Method | Reinforce | Reduce |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Respiration | Insert on exhale | Insert on inhale |
| Insertion | Insert slowly, withdraw fast | Insert fast, withdraw slowly |
| Cover the point | Cover immediately | Cover later |

---

## NEEDLING PATTERNS BASED ON GENDER/CONDITION

**Postnatal Patterns:**
- Insert first needle based on gender
- Male: Left side
- Female: Right side

**Prenatal Patterns:**
- For genetic or constitutional conditions
- Female: Left side
- Male: Right side

---

## FOUR NEEDLING PATTERNS

**1. Infinity Pattern:**
- Insert first needle based on gender
- Second point: Paired confluent point on opposite side
- Third point: Same as second point on opposite side
- Fourth point: Same as first point on opposite side

*Example for Female:*
1. Right SI-3
2. Left UB-62
3. Right UB-62
4. Left SI-3

**2. Completion Pattern:**
- Needle confluent points bilaterally
- Then needle coupled paired points

*Example:*
1. Left SI-3
2. Right SI-3
3. Left UB-62
4. Right UB-62

**3. Circulation Pattern:**
- Finish needling one side of channel, then finish other side

*Example for Yin Wei:*
- Needle Ki-9, Sp-16, Lv-14 on left side
- Then treat same points on right side

**4. Unilateral Condition:**
- Insert first needle(s) on opposite side of condition

*Example:*
- Left side gait issue in MS patient → needle right side first, then left side

# Extraordinary Vessel Diagnostic Protocols

## DIAGNOSIS METHODS
- Tongue
- Pulses
- Behavior
- Lifestyle
- Constitutional nature
- Signs and symptoms

---

## SIMPLE PROTOCOL (Treating Vessels Individually)

**Sequence:**
1. Yin Qiao Mai × 3 treatments
2. Yang Qiao Mai × 3 treatments
3. Yin Wei Mai × 3 treatments
4. Yang Wei Mai × 3 treatments

---

## PAIRED VESSEL PROTOCOL

**Requirements:**
- Patient must be emotionally stable
- Patient must have support structure (family, friends, community)

**Sequence:**
1. Yin Qiao Mai and Yang Qiao Mai paired × 3 treatments
2. Yin Wei Mai and Yang Wei Mai paired × 3 treatments

**After Qiao Mai and Wei Mai completion:**
- Begin work on four primaries (Ren Mai, Du Mai, Chong Mai, Dai Mai)

---

## IF PATIENT BECOMES UNSTABLE

**Actions:**
- Stop pairing vessels
- Treat each vessel independently: Yang Qiao Mai, Yin Qiao Mai, Yang Wei Mai, Yin Wei Mai
- If patient becomes emotionally unstable, stop extraordinary vessel treatments entirely
- Return to twelve primaries for support
- Use Kidney and Spleen points for stability
- Add Heart and/or Pericardium points to stabilize shen if appropriate
- Resume extraordinary treatments within two-week period if possible
- Monitor patient closely

---

## TREATMENT TIMING

**Ideal Schedule:**
- Three treatments within three weeks
- Short break between different vessels

---

## FOUR PRIMARIES TREATMENT SEQUENCE

**Recommended Options:**
1. Chong Mai → Ren Mai → Du Mai → Dai Mai
2. Ren Mai → Du Mai → Chong Mai → Dai Mai
3. Du Mai → Ren Mai → Chong Mai → Dai Mai

**Rules:**
- Ren Mai and Du Mai always consecutive (never separated)
- Dai Mai always treated last
- Primaries can be paired but generally treated independently
- Treat one vessel at a time before starting next

---

## REASONS TO SKIP PROTOCOL (Jump to Primaries First)

**Conditions:**
- Infertility
- Acute emotional/mental distress (e.g., suicide attempts)
- Patient has healthy Qiao Mai and Wei Mai

**Caution:**
- Skipping Qiao Mai/Wei Mai doesn't indicate absence of pathology
- May need to treat these vessels later in long-term strategy

---

## HEALTHY QIAO MAI INDICATORS
- Pleased with who they are
- Free to be spontaneous
- Capable of dancing with life gracefully
- Can navigate emotions in healthy manner
- Takes what comes their way
- Good musculoskeletal structure and condition

---

## HEALTHY WEI MAI INDICATORS
- Lives fully in present moment
- Not focused on past or obsessed with future
- Comfortable in present moment
- Sees present as precious time
- Generally optimistic
- Able to see benefit/lessons in each circumstance
- No internal issues (e.g., fatty liver, digestive issues)

---

## QIAO MAI AND WEI MAI ASSESSMENT

**When to Start with Qiao Mai:**
- One physical structure concern present

**When to Start with Wei Mai:**
- One internal issue present (fatty liver, digestive issues)

**Additional Indicators:**
- Nutrition essential to healthy communication between vessels
- Food cravings, sensitivities, allergies provide information about vessel conditioning

---

## CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
- **Qiao Mai:** The structure (container/house foundation, walls, roof)
- **Wei Mai:** The guts inside the structure (the mushy gushy/interior renovations)
- Treat physical body (container) first to ensure stability before clearing primaries

---

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES
- Keep treatment patient-centered
- Continuous observation and re-evaluation required
- Monitor patient feedback between treatments
- Latent conditions may manifest during treatment (continue established protocol)
- Systematic approach recommended for beginners (more conservative and gentle)

## GENERAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLES

**Master Point (MP) and Couple Point (CP) Rules:**
- Males: MP on left, CP on right
- Females: MP on right, CP on left
- Both needed to fully activate extraordinary vessel
- Use even technique (no needle action)
- Needle to fen depth

**Treatment Progression:**
- First treatment: MP and CP only
- Second treatment: MP + CP + 2-3 trajectory points (bilateral)
- Third treatment: MP + CP + 2-4 trajectory points (bilateral)

**Needle Retention:**
- Optimal: 30 minutes minimum
- Acceptable range: 20-40 minutes
- Maximum: 1 hour
- No lifting, thrusting, or twisting for MP and CP
- Gentle insertion only

**Treatment Frequency:**
- Ideal: Once weekly for 3 weeks without break
- Minimum: Every 2 weeks until 3 sessions completed
- Allow stability between treatments

**Trajectory Points:**
- Always needled bilaterally
- Can use tonification/sedation technique as needed
- Can apply moxa (trajectory points only, not MP/CP)
- Add gradually to avoid overwhelming patient
- Take on more spiritual role in extraordinary vessel context

**Off-Trajectory Points:**
- Use only in advanced treatments
- Not advised for beginners
- Use trajectory points for at least first 3 treatments
- Triple Burner points can assist energetic communication

**Pairing Vessels:**
- Not recommended for beginners
- Requires adequate knowledge and clinical experience
- Needle MP and CP of each vessel separately
- Open first vessel completely before opening second

## PRACTITIONER REFLECTIONS

**On Ren Mai Preponderance:**
- Practitioner embodies Ren Mai archetype (Mother)
- Focuses on patient's unique perfection, not pathology
- Helps patients feel worthiness through eyes of Mother
- Attracts patients who benefit from this archetype
- Specializes in stress-induced illness and existential crises

**Other Archetypes:**
- Du Mai: Father archetype (structure, confidence, courage)
- Chong Mai: Spiritual/shamanic energy
- Each practitioner naturally embodies certain vessel energies

**Patient Attraction Patterns:**
- Practitioners attract certain types of patients
- Practice evolves with knowledge and capacity
- Referrals often come from acupuncturists or psychotherapists
- Patients typically have first ancestry pathology, trauma history
- Complex cases that haven't responded to other treatments

**Key Philosophy:**
- Physical conditions not separate from spiritual deficiency
- Internal cultivation through direct experience
- Archetypal vessels offer opportunity for practitioner's jing to unfold
- Vessels will change the practitioner who uses them
- Avenue for becoming more of who you are

Possible Off-Trajectory Points

SPLEEN 8

	* When used in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, it is instrumental in mending a broken heart from the deepest levels to the exterior; from the yuan level to the wei level, it heals from the inside out. Its greatest strength is proven when combined with Spleen 15 in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, and it provides healing and support to the individual in most emotional distresses, especially in the recovery of a broken spirit whether the cause originated from a tragic disease, heartbreak, or trauma.
	* When the Spleen becomes sluggish or distressed, often disharmony manifests as menstrual issues and any irregular patterns in the function of a woman’s uterus, including infertility, as well as fluid and fatty build-up in the body. 
	* It is also uniquely poised to assist with Kidney qi.
	* From a mental perspective, it can add flexibility to a rigid or narrow-minded individual whose stubborn nature is an obstacle to their emotional growth and development.
	* It tills the hardened and barren Earth, nourishing and increasing the flow of blood and qi, and therefore offers a different perspective and experience of receiving sustenance.

	* for a patient who exhibits conditions related to wind in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, this is an excellent choice. 
	* When the Heart and spirit become disheveled, disorganized, or distressed, wind can kick up in the system and cause tremors, irregular uterine bleeding, abdominal cramping, and cramping in general.
	* While Liver 9 is a great point for many physical ailments, it is just as useful for emotional and mental issues. 
	* It helps relieve emotional pain in the same manner as physical pain. 
	* It is a natural mood stabilizer and disperses anxiousness to eliminate it.
	* It alleviates the physical and emotional effects one experiences from chronic health diseases, 
	including responses to chemotherapy. Liver 9 addresses chronic and lingering emotional disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and associated fatigue and stamina deficiencies.
	* In terms of needle action, Spleen 8 can be thrusted and tonified in the context of the Yin Wei Mai treatment, whereas Liver 9 should either be gently tonified or inserted using an “even technique,” to avoid further irritation.

* Description
	* The energetic properties of this point helps move one past blockages and stagnations. It is a junction of Yang and can influence Yang correspondences. 
	* The correspondences include thoughts, movement, activity, and actions. This point, along with other points in a treatment, can release one from the intensity of Yang correspondences of the Yang Wei. 
	* As a Yang junction, it can also assist in gathering and directing Yang into the body or releasing it.
	* Yang Wei cleft points are on the legs and deal with movement and the stagnations that may result from imbalances in movement. 
	* They can include too much movement or activity; they can also include lack of movement in life.

#### Possible Off-Trajectory Points
* Spleen 19, 20, and 21 
	* offer similar patterns of relief in cases of thoracic fullness, upper jiao fullness, upper respiratory issues including asthma and bronchitis, and general aches and pains. Consider the spirit of each point to differentiate and select one of these while treating in the context of the Yang Wei Mai.

* SPLEEN 19
	* Spleen 19 is generally used more for the physical benefits as opposed to emotional, mental, or spiritual. It helps to open the chest cavity for ease of breath, and to descend the qi when it is struggling to properly move through the upper jiao. It is a great point to add if the patient is currently coughing or wheezing or has a cold or virus that is impacting breath.

* SPLEEN 20
	* Spleen 20 is a better point for the physical if the pulmonary issues are also impacting the back, such as upper back discomfort or pain, or specific pain in the breast. Spleen 19 is more general while Spleen 20 is more specific in terms of signs and symptoms. One way to determine whether to add Spleen 19 or Spleen 20 (and you can always elect to do both) is if the patient is specifically complaining of difficulty breathing with back pain (usually in the flank area of the back) which is often because of chronic coughing. If the patient is not specifically complaining of back discomfort or chronic cough, Spleen 19 is a great point.

* SPLEEN 21
	* The most beautiful quality of Spleen 21 is that it brings harmony to the entire meridian system, whether the intention is to bring harmony on a physical, emotional, or spiritual level. If the intent is to tend to the patient on the physical level, Spleen 19 and 20 are both excellent points;
	* however, if the intent is to tend to the patient on a spiritual level, Spleen 21 is a far more appropriate point.
	* While it obviously offers benefit in opening the chest, allowing for deep breath, assisting with pain in the upper jiao, and regulating qi and blood, Spleen 21 is a great point to add for depression, lethargy, low motivation, and disorganization. Often when people experience a traumatic event, and these types of signs and symptoms occur (including common cold symptoms), they can become disheveled, disorganized, scattered, with feelings of being overwhelmed. 
	* In these cases, Spleen 21 is the better choice. It is the junction point of all junction points, especially when used in the context of an extraordinary vessel treatment. It is not only a grounding point but a nourishing point, and offers extraordinary support. 
	* It empowers the individual to feel solid within themselves, well, and connected.

* GALLBLADDER 29 (AND 30)
	* While these points are mostly used for physical pain and discomfort, they do lend themselves to treating spiritual imbalances as well. 
	* Pain or discomfort originating from a previous life can be lodged in the hips, and in fact this is common. Certainly, one can have trauma or injury from the present life, but if the person continues to experience pain or discomfort in the hip area after multiple attempts with
	other treatment approaches, a Yang Wei Mai treatment using both GB29 and GB30 can be helpful in resolving the past-life karma lodged in the hip. 
	* In this instance, applying a thrusting needle action to the points is appropriate, followed by dispersing action.
	* Hypothetically, a person has been treated for chronic hip pain and after multiple attempts using various theories, including the eight extraordinary vessels, the patient continues to experience hip pain. Perhaps the pain occurs less frequently or less intensely, but still causes discomfort from time to time or with certain activities. Revisiting the Yang Wei Mai and including GB29 and GB30 allows the past-life trauma enough time to emerge from the cellular level and exit the tissues. 
	* In this case, it is recommended to apply a thrusting action (for trajectory points only, not for the MP or CP) initially, followed by dispersing and retaining all needles for as long as 40 minutes. This treatment may need to be repeated multiple times, depending on the nature of the pain and the length of time the patient has lived with the issue. 
	* The practitioner needs to take into account any structural issues that may be present and represented on imaging. For example, if the patient is experiencing bone on bone or other types of structural issues, acupuncture can help with releasing heat (inflammation) and assist the healing process, but the patient may still need some type of surgery to remedy the structural issue.
	* Some common themes that may indicate the need for pairing these points include difficulty with direction, follow through, or moving forward with projects, personal or professional or both. 
	* If after several treatments and perhaps even other modalities (e.g., physical therapy, chiropractic work, etc.) the hip pain continues, the indecisiveness gets worse, and other symptoms begin to emerge (eye issues and connective tissue problems are some common adjunct problems), these points are recommended.
	* From an emotional standpoint, the patient experiences weariness with an underlying sadness (teary or close to tears at any moment—they may cry in private), and their thinking becomes more rigid. In fact, the rigidity can manifest both mentally and physically. 
	* People who appear stiff physically often have rigid mindsets as well. 
	* In some cases, this is described as “stubborn” or “unbending.” 
	* They lose perspective, becoming overly reactionary and argumentative. Underneath, and not spoken of, lie fear, anxiousness, and restlessness. 
	* A patient may be able to describe the feelings, but not what is causing them.
	* If the trauma is from a past-life situation, the person will not be able to identify a cause and will become more frustrated; or they may make something up in their mind regarding the  origin, but will not know for sure or believe their own story.
	* It is difficult for humans to live in the unknown, especially when there is pain with an unknown origin.

* GALLBLADDER 38
	* Gallbladder 38 is associated more closely with the mental experience, as opposed to the physical. While it shares a common theme with many Gallbladder points (e.g., tightness, rigidity, soreness, pain, vision problems, and so on), it is more about the perspective and emotions of the person. 
	* The patient will sigh a lot when speaking, have a more negative outlook on life, and seem to have no vision for the future. This is not to be confused with fatalistic thinking, which is associated with the Chong Mai. Rather, in this case there is more a depressive connotation in
	general, with pain either in the hips, connective tissue (anywhere in the body including fingers and toes), joints, migraines or headaches, low back pain, middle jiao discomfort, and signs of wind as well.
	* These patients need a ray of sunshine to enter their lives to get back on track, and that ray of sunshine could be a shift in perspective, not necessarily literal sunlight.
	* They are in a rut or a hole and have lost their ability to navigate out of the rut.
	* The light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, has gone, but they have not yet lost hope—they just feel discouraged. 
	* Opening the Yang Wei Mai and adding in GB38 will shift their perspective, allowing them to see their future once again, make a plan, or decide to alter the course they are seeking. It gives them optimism and reassurance for the future.

# Yang Qiao Mai

## **Channel Overview**
- **Master Point:** Bladder 62 (Shen Mai)
- **Couple Point:** Small Intestine 3
- **Primary Function:** Governs locomotion, stance, and engagement with external environment
- **Energetic Role:** Supports Du channel; regulates yang qi distribution to superficial tissues

---

## **Pathway**
**Origin:** Lateral heel (BL-62) → lateral malleolus (BL-61, BL-59) → lateral leg → lateral thigh → hip (GB-29) → posterior/lateral hypochondrium → posterior axillary fold → shoulder (SI-10, LI-15, LI-16) → neck → face (ST-4, ST-3, ST-1) → inner canthus (BL-1) → forehead → temporal region → brain via GB-20

**Key Intersections:**
- Meets Yang Wei at GB-29 (hip) and SI-10 (shoulder)
- Meets Yin Qiao at BL-1
- Enters brain via GB-20

---

## **Anatomical Areas of Influence**
- Lateral legs, hips, back
- Neck, shoulders
- Head, eyes, brain
- Three bony cavities: pelvis, ribcage, skull

---
