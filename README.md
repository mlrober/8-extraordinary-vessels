	* When used in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, it is instrumental in mending a broken heart from the deepest levels to the exterior; from the yuan level to the wei level, it heals from the inside out. Its greatest strength is proven when combined with Spleen 15 in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, and it provides healing and support to the individual in most emotional distresses, especially in the recovery of a broken spirit whether the cause originated from a tragic disease, heartbreak, or trauma.
	* When the Spleen becomes sluggish or distressed, often disharmony manifests as menstrual issues and any irregular patterns in the function of a woman’s uterus, including infertility, as well as fluid and fatty build-up in the body.

	* for a patient who exhibits conditions related to wind in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, this is an excellent choice. 
	* When the Heart and spirit become disheveled, disorganized, or distressed, wind can kick up in the system and cause tremors, irregular uterine bleeding, abdominal cramping, and cramping in general.
	* While Liver 9 is a great point for many physical ailments, it is just as useful for emotional and mental issues. 
	* It helps relieve emotional pain in the same manner as physical pain. 
	* It is a natural mood stabilizer and disperses anxiousness to eliminate it.
	* It alleviates the physical and emotional effects one experiences from chronic health diseases, 
	including responses to chemotherapy. Liver 9 addresses chronic and lingering emotional disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and associated fatigue and stamina deficiencies.
	* In terms of needle action, Spleen 8 can be thrusted and tonified in the context of the Yin Wei Mai treatment, whereas Liver 9 should either be gently tonified or inserted using an “even technique,” to avoid further irritation.

* Du 15 Ya Men Mute’s Gate
* Window to the Sky.
* Description
	* “Mute’s Gate” has a dual meaning. When we turn inward to connect to marrow or the Yuan level, there is no need to speak. Chinese philosophy is center-based. 
	* By turning inward to the center, we connect to our core and enter a deep peace and bliss.
	* In this deep realization of our Yuan level, there is no need to speak.

#### Possible Off-Trajectory Points
* Spleen 19, 20, and 21 
	* offer similar patterns of relief in cases of thoracic fullness, upper jiao fullness, upper respiratory issues including asthma and bronchitis, and general aches and pains. Consider the spirit of each point to differentiate and select one of these while treating in the context of the Yang Wei Mai.

* SPLEEN 19
	* Spleen 19 is generally used more for the physical benefits as opposed to emotional, mental, or spiritual. It helps to open the chest cavity for ease of breath, and to descend the qi when it is struggling to properly move through the upper jiao. It is a great point to add if the patient is currently coughing or wheezing or has a cold or virus that is impacting breath.

* SPLEEN 20
	* Spleen 20 is a better point for the physical if the pulmonary issues are also impacting the back, such as upper back discomfort or pain, or specific pain in the breast. Spleen 19 is more general while Spleen 20 is more specific in terms of signs and symptoms. One way to determine whether to add Spleen 19 or Spleen 20 (and you can always elect to do both) is if the patient is specifically complaining of difficulty breathing with back pain (usually in the flank area of the back) which is often because of chronic coughing. If the patient is not specifically complaining of back discomfort or chronic cough, Spleen 19 is a great point.

* SPLEEN 21
	* The most beautiful quality of Spleen 21 is that it brings harmony to the entire meridian system, whether the intention is to bring harmony on a physical, emotional, or spiritual level. If the intent is to tend to the patient on the physical level, Spleen 19 and 20 are both excellent points;
	* however, if the intent is to tend to the patient on a spiritual level, Spleen 21 is a far more appropriate point.
	* While it obviously offers benefit in opening the chest, allowing for deep breath, assisting with pain in the upper jiao, and regulating qi and blood, Spleen 21 is a great point to add for depression, lethargy, low motivation, and disorganization. Often when people experience a traumatic event, and these types of signs and symptoms occur (including common cold symptoms), they can become disheveled, disorganized, scattered, with feelings of being overwhelmed. 
	* In these cases, Spleen 21 is the better choice. It is the junction point of all junction points, especially when used in the context of an extraordinary vessel treatment. It is not only a grounding point but a nourishing point, and offers extraordinary support. 
	* It empowers the individual to feel solid within themselves, well, and connected.

* GALLBLADDER 29 (AND 30)
	* While these points are mostly used for physical pain and discomfort, they do lend themselves to treating spiritual imbalances as well. 
	* Pain or discomfort originating from a previous life can be lodged in the hips, and in fact this is common. Certainly, one can have trauma or injury from the present life, but if the person continues to experience pain or discomfort in the hip area after multiple attempts with
	other treatment approaches, a Yang Wei Mai treatment using both GB29 and GB30 can be helpful in resolving the past-life karma lodged in the hip. 
	* In this instance, applying a thrusting needle action to the points is appropriate, followed by dispersing action.
	* Hypothetically, a person has been treated for chronic hip pain and after multiple attempts using various theories, including the eight extraordinary vessels, the patient continues to experience hip pain. Perhaps the pain occurs less frequently or less intensely, but still causes discomfort from time to time or with certain activities. Revisiting the Yang Wei Mai and including GB29 and GB30 allows the past-life trauma enough time to emerge from the cellular level and exit the tissues. 
	* In this case, it is recommended to apply a thrusting action (for trajectory points only, not for the MP or CP) initially, followed by dispersing and retaining all needles for as long as 40 minutes. This treatment may need to be repeated multiple times, depending on the nature of the pain and the length of time the patient has lived with the issue. 
	* The practitioner needs to take into account any structural issues that may be present and represented on imaging. For example, if the patient is experiencing bone on bone or other types of structural issues, acupuncture can help with releasing heat (inflammation) and assist the healing process, but the patient may still need some type of surgery to remedy the structural issue.
	* Some common themes that may indicate the need for pairing these points include difficulty with direction, follow through, or moving forward with projects, personal or professional or both. 
	* If after several treatments and perhaps even other modalities (e.g., physical therapy, chiropractic work, etc.) the hip pain continues, the indecisiveness gets worse, and other symptoms begin to emerge (eye issues and connective tissue problems are some common adjunct problems), these points are recommended.
	* From an emotional standpoint, the patient experiences weariness with an underlying sadness (teary or close to tears at any moment—they may cry in private), and their thinking becomes more rigid. In fact, the rigidity can manifest both mentally and physically. 
	* People who appear stiff physically often have rigid mindsets as well. 
	* In some cases, this is described as “stubborn” or “unbending.” 
	* They lose perspective, becoming overly reactionary and argumentative. Underneath, and not spoken of, lie fear, anxiousness, and restlessness. 
	* A patient may be able to describe the feelings, but not what is causing them.
	* If the trauma is from a past-life situation, the person will not be able to identify a cause and will become more frustrated; or they may make something up in their mind regarding the  origin, but will not know for sure or believe their own story.
	* It is difficult for humans to live in the unknown, especially when there is pain with an unknown origin.

* GALLBLADDER 38
	* Gallbladder 38 is associated more closely with the mental experience, as opposed to the physical. While it shares a common theme with many Gallbladder points (e.g., tightness, rigidity, soreness, pain, vision problems, and so on), it is more about the perspective and emotions of the person. 
	* The patient will sigh a lot when speaking, have a more negative outlook on life, and seem to have no vision for the future. This is not to be confused with fatalistic thinking, which is associated with the Chong Mai. Rather, in this case there is more a depressive connotation in
	general, with pain either in the hips, connective tissue (anywhere in the body including fingers and toes), joints, migraines or headaches, low back pain, middle jiao discomfort, and signs of wind as well.
	* These patients need a ray of sunshine to enter their lives to get back on track, and that ray of sunshine could be a shift in perspective, not necessarily literal sunlight.
	* They are in a rut or a hole and have lost their ability to navigate out of the rut.
	* The light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, has gone, but they have not yet lost hope—they just feel discouraged. 
	* Opening the Yang Wei Mai and adding in GB38 will shift their perspective, allowing them to see their future once again, make a plan, or decide to alter the course they are seeking. It gives them optimism and reassurance for the future.
