Possible Off-Trajectory Points

SPLEEN 8
	* Spleen 8 is the blood of the Earth; it motivates, tills, and supports the Spleen meridian, so it is useful in addressing issues of fertility, blood disorders, and most types of cancer.
	* From a spiritual perspective, it provides a level of grounding and centering like no other point on the trajectory and nourishes the spirit of the blood as it makes it way throughout the kingdom of an individual.
	* When used in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, it is instrumental in mending a broken heart from the deepest levels to the exterior; from the yuan level to the wei level, it heals from the inside out. Its greatest strength is proven when combined with Spleen 15 in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, and it provides healing and support to the individual in most emotional distresses, especially in the recovery of a broken spirit whether the cause originated from a tragic disease, heartbreak, or trauma.
	* When the Spleen becomes sluggish or distressed, often disharmony manifests as menstrual issues and any irregular patterns in the function of a woman’s uterus, including infertility, as well as fluid and fatty build-up in the body. 
	* It is also uniquely poised to assist with Kidney qi.
	* From a mental perspective, it can add flexibility to a rigid or narrow-minded individual whose stubborn nature is an obstacle to their emotional growth and development.
	* It tills the hardened and barren Earth, nourishing and increasing the flow of blood and qi, and therefore offers a different perspective and experience of receiving sustenance.
	* In summary, it supports issues of the lower jiao: infertility, urinary issues, pelvic floor prolapses, and fatty tissue or fluid build-up, as common examples. 
	* It plants new seeds for growing and vitality. It shakes up the Earth element, tills the soil, harmonizes the pulses, and brings a smile to an otherwise barren face.

LIVER 9
	* Liver 9 is instrumental in addressing issues of fertility, and lower jiao issues in general. 
	* it is useful for agitation, irritation, and wind conditions.
	* for a patient who exhibits conditions related to wind in the context of the Yin Wei Mai, this is an excellent choice. 
	* When the Heart and spirit become disheveled, disorganized, or distressed, wind can kick up in the system and cause tremors, irregular uterine bleeding, abdominal cramping, and cramping in general.
	* While Liver 9 is a great point for many physical ailments, it is just as useful for emotional and mental issues. 
	* It helps relieve emotional pain in the same manner as physical pain. 
	* It is a natural mood stabilizer and disperses anxiousness to eliminate it.
	* It alleviates the physical and emotional effects one experiences from chronic health diseases, 
	including responses to chemotherapy. Liver 9 addresses chronic and lingering emotional disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and associated fatigue and stamina deficiencies.
	* In terms of needle action, Spleen 8 can be thrusted and tonified in the context of the Yin Wei Mai treatment, whereas Liver 9 should either be gently tonified or inserted using an “even technique,” to avoid further irritation.
