* Ascends the **medial leg**
* Rises to:

  * **Inguinal crease**
  * **Sexual organs (yin region)**
* Passes through:

  * **Pelvic cavity**
  * **Abdomen**

## RELATIONSHIP WITH YANG QIAO MAI

* Yin and Yang Qiao:

  * Originate from the brain

  * Both moisten and regulate the eyes
* Excess patterns:

  * **Yin Qiao excess** → eyes close, cannot open
  * **Yang Qiao excess** → eyes open, cannot close
* Musculoskeletal reflection:

  * Excess Yin → medial leg tension, lateral flaccidity
  * Excess Yang → lateral tension, medial flaccidity
